        <title>The Golden Zone</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>There is a damaging and pervasive myth in the health and fitness industry. </p>
<p>Actually there’s a bunch of them, but this is a big one: <strong>the myth that eating <em>healthy</em> food will help you lose weight</strong>.  </p>
<p>If you’ve ever been on a diet, you might have experienced being bombarded with people’s recommendations to eat a particular food because it is “<em>healthy</em>”.</p>
<p>It’s repeated by everyone from <a href="/blog/healthy-organic-post" target="_blank" title='A Healthy, Organic, Naturally Flavoured Post'>malicious marketers</a> to well-meaning grandparents. </p>
<p>This recommendation contains the implicit assumption that <em>healthy</em> and <em>low calorie</em> are inseparable concepts. </p>
<p>The malicious marketer is delighted that you don’t understand the difference between <em>healthy</em> and <em>low calorie</em>. It allows them to label their product as one and know that you’ll assume the other. </p>
<p>Your well-meaning granny has no idea that there is a difference between <em>healthy</em> and <em>low calorie</em>. She just wants you to be happy. </p>
<picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--head">

</picture><p class ="figurecap"> “<em>I baked you some healthy raisin cookies for your new diet!</em>” </p>

<p>Although granny means the best, there is a huge difference between calling a food <em>healthy</em> and calling it <em>low calorie</em>. </p>
<p><strong><em>Healthy</em></strong> is used to describe foods that have a lot of micronutrients and/or other elements that improve your health in one way or another. Elements like <em>antioxidants</em> to help reduce free radicals (unstable molecules), <em>anthocyanins</em> for your brain, or <em>fibre</em> to help you poop. </p>
<p><strong><em>Low calorie</em></strong> is used to describe foods that are low in calories (<em><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/xT0xeJpnrWC4XWblEk/giphy.gif" target="_blank" title='Mind = Blown.'>whoa</a></em>). Calories are a measure of the energy inside your food. When you consume more energy than you expend, the remaining energy is stored as fat (<em>or muscle if you’re doing it right</em>).  When you consume less energy than you expend, your body breaks down fat (<em>or muscle</em>) to make up the difference. So eating <em>low calorie</em> food is a great way to lose weight. </p>
<p>Notice how the definition of <em>healthy</em> didn’t include any mention of weight loss? And the definition of <em>low calorie</em> didn’t include any mention of health? That’s because <em>healthy</em> ≠ <em>low calorie</em>. </p>
<p><strong><em>Healthy food does not have to be low calorie, and low calorie food does not have to be healthy.</em></strong> </p>
<p>But that’s not to say it can’t be. When a food is both <em>healthy</em> and <em>low calorie</em>, that’s <strong>The Golden Zone</strong>.</p>
<picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--head">
  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/the-golden-zone.png" alt="A two circle Venn diagram with healthy on one side, and low calorie on the other. The Golden Zone is the overlap between the two circles.">
</picture><p class ="figurecap"> Healthy + Low Calorie = The Golden Zone </p>

<p>The Golden Zone is the overlap between healthy and low calorie. These are the foods that tick all of your nutritional boxes. </p>
<p><strong><em>Golden Zone foods are healthy.</em></strong>  Depending on which food, this could mean protection against heart disease and cancer, reduced inflammation, improved memory, better insulin sensitivity, and many other characteristics that we associate with good health.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Golden Zone foods are low in calories.</em></strong> This makes them great for keeping you full, and helping you lose weight. </p>
<p>Examples of Golden Zone foods are: white fish, eggs, cottage cheese, and most vegetables (<em>full table <a href="/blog/the-golden-zone#table" target="_blank" title='Healthy, Low Calorie or Golden Zone.'>shown here</a></em>). They are nutrient dense from both a calorie and volume perspective, which means they will help keep you full in the moment <em>and</em> healthy long term.</p>
<p>A diversified diet rich in Golden Zone foods is ideal for weight management and long term health. That translates to a better looking, more athletic, and disease-free you. </p>
<p>So this begs the question… how many eggs do you have to eat before your 6 pack shows up?  Are you allowed to eat anything that’s not a Golden Zone food? And wasn’t eating an ‘<em>apple a day</em>’ already enough to avoid medical intervention entirely? </p>
<p>Well let’s back up a bit. First off, there are at least 2 good reasons to avoid eating Golden Zone foods. </p>
<h3>Reason #1: You’re Bulking</h3><p>Bulking is intentionally eating in a calorie surplus in an attempt to gain weight. We almost always want this weight in the form of muscle, not fat (<em>with sumo wrestlers being the obvious exception</em>). </p>
<p>Some people have difficulty eating enough food during a bulk to reach their calorie target. If you’re one of those people, then you have good reason to not eat Golden Zone foods. </p>
<p>Why? Well since Golden Zone foods are low calorie – and you’re struggling to get enough calories – you’re better off sticking to the pure <em>healthy</em> zone foods. This will allow you to more easily hit your calorie targets whilst still getting a large amount of nutrients. </p>
<p>To help hit your calorie targets, some common substitutions include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Replacing chicken breast with fattier cuts of beef. </li>
<li>Replacing almonds with macadamias. </li>
<li>Replacing spinach with sweet potatoes. </li>
<li>Replacing toothpaste with peanut butter. </li>
</ul>
<p>Etc. Now this obviously doesn’t make Golden Zone foods ‘<em>bad for you</em>’ in this situation. They’re just not the best choice, given your goals. </p>
<h3>Reason #2: You’re Human</h3><p>A bit tongue-in-cheek, but this will present itself in one way or another. If you’re in this for the long term, then you’re guaranteed to find yourself in many situations that make 100% clean eating near impossible. </p>
<p>Situations like: </p>
<ul>
<li>Having a big night out with the boys after getting a promotion</li>
<li>Your boss offering you their home-baked cookies the morning of your performance review </li>
<li>Dominoes cheaper Tuesdays </li>
</ul>
<p>Etc. In all seriousness, there are practical reasons to not eat Golden Zone foods. Sometimes they won’t be available. Sometimes you’ll splurge during a special event.</p>
<p>Alternatively... you could <strong><em>intentionally</em></strong> include unhealthy food as a part of your diet.</p>
<picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--new13">
  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/my-cookies.gif" alt="Arnold Schwarzenegger: 'Who told you you could eat my cookies?'">
</picture><p class ="figurecap"> But you didn’t hear it from me.</p>

<h3>Eating the Cookie on Purpose</h3><p>Let me start with a quote from nutrition researcher <a href="https://alanaragon.com/about-alan/" target="_blank" title='Who is Alan Aragon?'>Alan Aragon</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Dietary perfection is a myth. It doesn’t exist. There is no Unicorn Diet for humans. Ten percent of the diet coming from anything you want might sound rebellious until you switch things around and see that 90 percent of the diet is a diligent effort to cover all the bases…”</p>
<p>– Alan Aragon </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alan recommends taking a 90/10 approach to dieting:</p>
<ul>
<li>90% from whole and minimally processed foods (<em>with some exceptions, like <a href="https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-511X-11-67" target="_blank" title='Health Benefits of Whey Protein'>whey protein</a></em>)</li>
<li>10% from whatever you want (<em>which Alan calls “pure junky goodness”</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Alan also shares a few anecdotes of people who have lived for a very long time while subsisting on common “<em>junk</em>” foods. Like the <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13119227/ns/health-diet_and_nutrition/t/man-lived-sausage-and-waffles-diet/" target="_blank" title='Man lived to 112 on sausage-and-waffles diet'>late George Johnson</a> who lived to 112 years old eating ‘<em>a diet largely of sausages and waffles</em>’. </p>
<p>Quite a few of the longest-living humans also seem to have had a weak spot for chocolate. </p>
<picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--new14">
  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/eating-chocolate.gif" alt="Homer eating brownies.">
</picture><p class ="figurecap">“<em>Did he just say chocolate is good for me?</em>”</p>

<p>While I don’t find these anecdotes all that convincing on their own – they feel similar to the stories smokers tell you of their 99-year-old chain-smoking marathon-running grandpa – there is wisdom within Alan’s recommendation.</p>
<p>There are <em>diminishing returns</em> to the benefits of eating micronutrient-rich sources of food. Studies that show the largest benefits are almost always in the context of <strong><em>correcting a deficiency</em></strong>. This is fundamentally different to putting the finishing touches on an otherwise admirable diet. </p>
<p>If you are eating fish every day, then you won’t see much benefit taking fish oil. If you are in the sun for most of the day, then you won’t see much benefit taking vitamin D. And if you’re eating a lot of fruit, then you won’t see much benefit taking vitamin C.</p>
<p>Why? Because <strong><em>you don’t get bonus points for going over your micronutrient needs</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Now all this is based on the notion that you’re able to cover all your bases with <em>only</em> 90% of your diet. Which you most definitely can – <em>if</em> you’re eating whole and minimally processed foods. That translates to food in the <em>healthy</em> zone. </p>
<p>If you’re eating Golden Zone foods, you’ll be able to cover your bases with ~80% of your diet. Why? Well that’s 80% of your diet calorie-wise. So Golden Zone foods – which are by definition nutrient dense and low calorie – are a great way to get the nutrients you need without going over your calorie budget. </p>
<p>Vegetables get a special shout out here for being low calorie with a <em>diverse assortment</em> of vitamins and minerals – see <a href="http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=9" target="_blank" title='The Health Benefits of Broccoli'>broccoli</a> and <a href="http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=43" target="_blank" title='The Health Benefits of Spinach'>spinach</a> for great examples. </p>
<h3>Crunching the Numbers</h3><p>Let’s say you <a href="/calorie-calculator/" target="_blank" title='Calorie and Macronutrient Calculator'>calculate your calories</a> to be 2000 calories per day. 10-20% of that gives you 200-400 calories/day of “<em>pure junky goodness</em>” to work with. We’ll take the average of 300 calories/day for the below examples. </p>
<p>You can consume these ~300 calories as a “<em>daily treat</em>”, or you can bank the calories and use several days’ worth in one sitting. Some ideas: </p>
<ul>
<li>1 Original Glazed Krispy Kreme every day (<a class="no-ul" href="https://www.krispykreme.com.au/media/wysiwyg/pdf/Nutritional-Information.pdf" target="_blank" title='Calories in a Krispy Kreme'>~193 cal</a>) </li>
<li>1 KitKat Chocolate bar every day (<a class="no-ul" href="https://www.kitkat.co.uk/content/kitkatcollection/FourFinger" target="_blank" title='Calories in a KitKat'>~209 cal</a>; <em>the full 4 fingers – not the recommended 2 finger “serving size”</em>) </li>
<li>200g of Cookies &amp; Cream Connoisseur Ice Cream every 2 days (<a class="no-ul" href="http://www.connoisseuricecream.com.au/tubs/" target="_blank" title='Calories in Connoisseur Ice Cream'>~540 cal</a>; <em>I doubt anyone has ever followed the 64g “serving size”</em>) </li>
<li>5 slices of Dominoes BBQ Meatloves pizza every 3 days (<a class="no-ul" href="https://www.dominos.com.au/media/90963/traditional-range-2018.pdf" target="_blank" title='Calories in Dominos Pizza'>~810 cal</a>) </li>
<li>1 large Big Mac Meal every 5 days (<a class="no-ul" href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.za/menuItem/big-mac-meal" target="_blank" title='Calories in McDonalds Big Mac Meal'>~1476 cal</a>) </li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing how many calories are in your favourite junk foods helps you make more satisfying meal choices. </p>
<p>For instance, the above dot points tell me that I should never go to McDonalds. Why? Because not only do I prefer the <em>taste</em> of pizza over a Big Mac, but it’s also a <em>lot</em> less calories for what I would consider a satiating meal. So going to Dominoes instead of McDonalds makes sense from a taste <em>and</em> calorie point of view. </p>
<p>Now if you <em>love</em> McDonalds and crave a Big Mac above all else, then that’s fine too. If you’re happy with the trade-off, then enjoy a guilt-free Big Mac. </p>
<p>As long as you stay within your <em>calorie budget</em> – spend your junk calories on whatever food your taste buds’ desire. </p>
<h3>Wrapping it Up</h3><p>You could be forgiven for forgetting this post was about eating healthy, low calorie foods – not optimising how much pizza you can cram into your diet. </p>
<p>Some take-away points: </p>
<ul>
<li>Healthy and low calorie mean very different things </li>
<li>You can’t go wrong eating Golden Zone food – food that is both healthy and low calorie</li>
<li>It’s okay to eat <em>pure junky goodness</em> sometimes – approximately 10-20% of your diet is fine</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no one way to diet – just as there is no one way to parent a child or roast a turkey. But there are terrible ways to do all three. </p>
<p><strong>So don’t get burned by another fad diet.</strong></p>
<p>Think about the food in the Golden Zone that <strong>you</strong> enjoy the most. Basing your diet around this food is an effective and practical way to achieve <strong><em>lasting</em></strong> aesthetics and health. </p>
<p>And since we’re creating <strong>a diet that will last</strong>, we will include some room for indulgence. </p>

<p>The table below gives typical examples of Healthy, Low Calorie, and Golden Zone foods.</p>
<p>The table is <strong><em>not</em></strong> comprehensive – in part because there are too many foods in existence to classify. But it should be more than enough to get started. </p>

        <title>The Australian Health Star Disaster</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government has come up with a fantastic new way to keep their taxpayers trim.</p>
<p>It’s ingenious. </p>
<p>They label each food with a <strong><em>health star rating</em></strong> out of 5. </p>
<p>The full 5 stars is reserved for only the most audacious of health foods. Think 17-Grain-Gluten-Free quinoa.</p>
<p>Eating healthy has never been so easy. 6 pack abs is now within reach to anyone that can count to 5. </p>
<p>Maccas might as well pack up shop now. Colonel Sanders’ reign is over. Long live the standing desk. The <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-statistics/behaviours-risk-factors/overweight-obesity/overview" target="_blank" title='Obesity in Australia'>Australian obesity epidemic</a>  is over – <em>Right?</em></p>
<p>There are many complexities and nuances to nutrition. So did the government really succeed in simplifying this complexity to a star rating out of 5?</p>
<p>.... <strong>nope</strong>.</p>
<picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--16x9">
  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/pickle-heath-star.jpg" alt="Pickle Rick Boom Big Reveal">
</picture><p class ="figurecap"> <em><b>Boom, big reveal</b></em> (3.5 stars) </p>

<p>What does a food being “<em>healthy</em>” mean to you? </p>
<p>Although you can point to some foods you would consider healthy, you might find defining it to be a challenge. You would be in close company.</p>
<p>If you were to ask 10 different people, you would get 10 different definitions. These explanations are often quite hand-wavey, prompting further questions (what exactly does “<em>good for you</em>” mean Stacey?).</p>
<p>And that’s exactly what the Australian Health Star Rating does. Prompt further questions. Like “<em>who in their right mind would advocate such terrible nutritional advice</em>”.</p>
<p>But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Just what is a “Health Star Rating”? According to the <a href="http://healthstarrating.gov.au/internet/healthstarrating/publishing.nsf/Content/About-health-stars" target="_blank" title='What is a Health Star Rating?'>Health Star Rating website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Health Star Rating is a front-of-pack labelling system that rates the overall nutritional profile of packaged food and assigns it a rating from ½ a star to 5 stars. It provides a quick, easy, standard way to compare similar packaged foods. The more stars, the healthier the choice.”</em>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You read right – <strong>The more stars, the healthier the choice</strong>. It turns out that the nuances of nutrition were all in our head! The government managed to compact these complexities into 5 simple stars. </p>
<p>Before I wrap up this post, we had better have a look at some of these ratings:</p>

  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/milo-heath-star.jpg" alt="Milo 4.5 Health Star Rating">
</picture><p class ="figurecap"> Milo – 4.5 Health Stars </p>

<p>Huh? That doesn’t seem right. Didn’t more stars mean more healthy? </p>
<p>Beer batter fries aren’t usually what comes to mind when we think of health foods. And isn’t Milo just sugar? </p>
<p>Well, remember this part of the Health Star definition: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“...It provides a quick, easy, standard way to <strong>compare similar packaged foods</strong>.”</em>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar. Packaged. Foods. Oh. So we’re not comparing chicken breast to quinoa. <strong><em>We’re comparing beer battered fries to chilli cheese fries</em></strong>. That’s not useful, that’s just misleading.</p>
<p>And what is a “<em>similar packaged food</em>” exactly? Are we comparing breakfast cereals with other breakfast choices – like eggs or oats – or only against other breakfast cereals. Is the relative “<em>healthiness</em>” of <a href="https://www.kelloggs.com.au/en_AU/brands/coco-pops.html" target="_blank" title='Kellogg‘s Coco Pops'>Coco Pops</a> vs  <a href="https://www.kelloggs.com.au/en_AU/brands/froot-loops.html" target="_blank" title='Kellogg‘s Fruit Loops'>Fruit Loops</a> useful to anyone with more than 3 brain cells? </p>
<p>So what is a “<em>similar packaged food</em>” that we’re comparing Milo to exactly... Nesquik?</p>
<picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--16x9">
  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/nesquik-heath-star.jpg" alt="Nesquik Health Star Rating">
</picture><p class ="figurecap"> Nesquik – ?? Health Stars </p>

<p>Looks like Nesquik doesn’t have a Health Star Rating. And herein lies another problem with Health Stars – <a href="http://healthstarrating.gov.au/internet/healthstarrating/publishing.nsf/Content/About-health-stars" target="_blank" title='Who developed the Health Star Rating system?'><strong><em>it’s a voluntary rating system</em></strong></a>. That’s right. Don’t like your dodgy rating? No worries – just don’t show it! </p>
<p>This still doesn’t explain how chocolate-coated sugar (Milo) got a 4.5 star health rating. Even compared to deep-fried ice cream Milo doesn’t deserve 4.5 stars. </p>
<p>Well lucky for Milo, there is an “<em>as prepared</em>” rule. This allows companies to rate products based on their suggested recipe for preparation rather than their standalone nutritional value. And how do we prepare Milo? We <del>inject it directly into our blood stream</del> have it with a 200ml glass of skim milk. </p>
<p>Milo + Skim Milk = 4.5 stars. If Milo’s healthiness was based on its own merits, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/am/food-industry-stalling-on-health-star-rule-review/9032848" target="_blank" title='Food industry stalling on health star rule review'>it would get 1.5 stars.</a> </p>

</picture><p class ="figurecap"> The Magic of “<em>As Prepared</em>” </p>

<p>Since skim milk is <a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/4364.0.55.007~2011-12~Main%20Features~Milk%20products%20and%20dishes~721" target="_blank" title='Australian Health Survey - Milk Products and Dishes'>only 11% of consumed dairy milk</a>, that’s <em>probably</em> not how the Milo was prepared. Not to forget the people who forgo the milk altogether. Anything from “<a href="http://thesmartlocal.com/read/milo-recipes" target="_blank" title='How People Really Eat Milo'><em>Easy Fried Milo French Toast</em></a>” to taking it straight from the spoon (<em>like a normal person</em>).</p>
<p>By that logic sugar deserves at least a 4 Health Star Rating. After all, it is <em>intended</em> to be “<em>as prepared</em>” in a coffee with skim milk. </p>
<p>Coffee + skim milk + sugar = 4 stars. Now I can stick a big “<em>4 Health Star Rating</em>” label on my sugar, and still sleep well at night knowing that my product has more nutritional integrity than Milo.</p>
<p>Arguably the best part about the new health star rating is its direct contradiction to other government recommendations. The <a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/guidelines" target="_blank" title='Australian Dietary Guidelines'>Australian Dietary Guidelines</a> takes a whole-foods approach to dieting, encouraging Australians to eat a wide variety of nutritious foods. It even <a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/guidelines/about-australian-dietary-guidelines" target="_blank" title='How do I make healthy food choices?'>calls out the bad tendency fad-diet’s have</a> of unnecessarily strict diet restrictions (<em>cough</em> Paleo Diet <em>cough</em>): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The advice focuses on dietary patterns that promote health and wellbeing rather than recommending that you eat – or completely avoid – specific foods.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That actually sounds reasonable. The infographic is pretty good too: </p>
<picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--3">
  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/australian-guide-to-healthy-eating.jpg" alt="The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating">
</picture><p class ="figurecap"> The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating </p>

<p>Definitely not perfect (<em>the biggest section should <strong>not</strong> be grain foods</em>), but reasonable. </p>
<p>In contrast, the Health Star Rating system bases its healthiness on the nutritional composition of the food. Give <a href="http://healthstarrating.gov.au/internet/healthstarrating/publishing.nsf/Content/online-calculator#/step/1" target="_blank" title='Health Star Rating Online Calculator'>the online calculator</a> a product’s energy, saturated fat, total sugars, sodium, protein, fibre, and % fruit and vegetable content, and it will spit out a star rating. Because <em>that’s all that matters</em> when it comes to eating healthy! </p>
<p>These two rating systems take a very different approach to evaluating the “<em>healthiness</em>” of a food. Notice in the above infographic our beloved 4 star beer batter fries receive the worst rating of “<em>Only sometimes and in small amounts</em>”. Whoops. </p>
<p>Nutrition can be confusing enough on its own without the government contradicting itself. The point of the rating system was to provide a simple way for people to understand how “<em>healthy</em>” a product is. </p>
<p>It was targeted at those who – whether due to time restrictions, different priorities, or confusion caused by the hundreds of conflicting opinions – are in the dark when it comes to nutrition.</p>
<p>The target market is certainly not the type to read the fine print on the back of a box. Or go onto the Health Star Rating website to understand the details of how the stars are allocated. </p>
<p>They’re the type to quickly count the number of stars on the label and use that as an indication for how healthy the product is. This seems to have been the <em>intent</em> of the Heath Star Rating system, it just got lost in the nonsense of “<em>as prepared</em>” and “<em>similar packaged food</em>”. Now the system is fanning the already hot flames of confusion that surround nutrition.</p>
<p>In short: the Australian Health Star Rating system is a castle in the air, connected to the ground by thin strings of nutritional science. </p>
<p>Don’t rely on it for anything other than a good laugh.</p>

        <title>A Healthy, Organic, Naturally Flavoured Post</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Healthy. Organic. Gluten free. Fat free. No Added Sugar. Do these labels sound familiar? </p>
<p>They’re a great way for a company to sincerely inform you of the positive aspects of their product. But more often than not, they’re used to dupe you into believing that what you’re buying is somehow ‘<em>good for you</em>’. This can lead to problems if you’re not aware of exactly what a claim means.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a typical example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stacey has just started a new diet, and is browsing her local supermarket</li>
<li>Stacey buys a pack of nut bars that claim to be a <em>“healthy snack”</em></li>
<li>Every time Stacey gets hungry between meals, she nibbles on a nut bar</li>
<li>2 weeks and a couple boxes later, Stacey is 2 pounds heavier</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be a very frustrating experience for Stacey, who was under the impression that replacing her favourite chocolate with this <em>“healthy snack”</em> would help her lose weight. </p>
<p>Stacey’s weight loss woes can be attributed to clever marketing blended with a lack consumer understanding. Like many people, Stacey has associated the word <em>“healthy”</em> to <em>“low calorie”</em>.  <strong><em>But “healthy” and “low calorie” do not mean the same thing.</em></strong>  </p>
<p>Something is usually deemed <em>healthy</em> (or <em>“good for you”</em>) due to it having a lot of <a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/vitamins-and-minerals" target="_blank" title="Micronutrient defined">micronutrients</a> (i.e. vitamins &amp; minerals), regardless of its <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/macronutrients-as-sources-of-food-energy/DDF89DE14E92D39D56A45FBAA3F00A55 " target="_blank" title="Macronutrient defined">macronutrient</a> content. Macronutrients are fat, protein and carbohydrates. They define the calorie content of your food,  and hence the success of your weight loss efforts. </p>
<p>If Stacey were brave enough to flip the box and read the nutrition label, she would find that these <em>healthy</em> nut bars have a lot of fat in them. Although many would argue these to be <em>“healthy fats”</em>, this does not relieve them of their high calorie content. If you’re not careful with your portion size they can easily lead to unwanted weight gain.</p>
<p>Note that the supplier hasn’t actually lied about their product. Nuts are <em>healthy</em>, but something can be <em>healthy</em> without requiring it to be low in calories – nuts being a prime example. The conflation of these characteristics can lead people to believe that a product is something it’s not.</p>
<picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--new">
  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/walnuts-vs-chocolate.jpg" alt="Calories in Chocolate vs. Walnuts">
</picture><p class ="figurecap"> Walnuts actually contain more calories per gram than chocolate, with around ~65 calories/10g, while chocolate is ~50-60 calories/10g [depending on the type and % of cacao] <a title="Calories in Walnuts" target="_blank" href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/12155?fgcd=&manu=&format=&count=&max=25&offset=&sort=default&order=asc&qlookup=walnut&ds=SR&qt=&qp=&qa=&qn=&q=&ing=">[1]</a>
<a title="Calories in Chocolate" target="_blank" href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/19081?man=&lfacet=&count=&max=25&qlookup=chocolate&offset=&sort=default&format=Abridged&reportfmt=other&rptfrm=&ndbno=&nutrient1=&nutrient2=&nutrient3=&subset=&totCount=&measureby=&Qv=1&Q333352=1&Q333353=1&Qv=10&Q333352=1&Q333353=1">[2]</a></p> 

<p>Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not hating on nut bars. I’m merely using them as an example to illustrate my point. I could just as easily have talked about candy that boasts about having <em>“No Artificial Colours or Flavours”</em> or being <em>“99% Fat Free”</em>. The number of people who read these labels and think <em>“These are good for me”</em> is concerning. Once familiar with this type of advertising, you’ll instead instantly conclude: <em>“Made with 100% Sugar”</em>.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that sugar is the devil and you should avoid it at all costs – because it definitely isn’t and you definitely shouldn’t. But when you indulge on a sweet treat it’s important to be aware that it is just that – a sweet treat. Otherwise there’ll be no guilt stopping you from heading down to your local burger joint and ordering a big mac and fries for round 2. I mean, why not – you’ve eaten so well today! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But when you indulge on a sweet treat make sure you’re mentally aware that it is just that – a sweet treat.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such an eating habit can easily lead to a calorie surplus and unwanted weight gain.</p>
<picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--new2">
  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/majin-buu-eating.gif" alt="Eating cake">
</picture><p class ="figurecap"> Don’t worry – it’s Gluten Free </p>

<p>I don’t think this is purely a marketing problem. If a candy company wants to accurately label its product as having <em>“No Artificial Colours or Flavours”</em>, they should be able to. That way those looking to buy candy without artificial colours or flavours will be able to easily identify what products they can choose from.</p>
<p>To fix this issue long term, we need to bridge the gap in consumer knowledge. <em>“No Artificial Colours or Flavours”</em> on a pack of candy should not distract you from the fact that candy is 100% sugar. Although it would be convenient, I think it’s unrealistic to expect a company to actively market such information. Until crooked teeth become fashionable, we probably won’t see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No artificial colours or flavours. Boatloads of sugar.”</p>
<p>— Nestl&eacute;  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The underlying issue is the <strong><em>information asymmetry</em></strong> between suppliers and consumers. Suppliers know exactly what’s in their products. Consumers don’t. The best they can do is read and interpret the product’s labelling. But <strong><em>the goal of most labelling is to sell, not to inform</em></strong>. So a consumer must be able to correctly interpret what a label (or buzzword) means.</p>
<p>Although the average consumer is better at reading a label than they used to be, that doesn’t say much. I’ve known people who thought a product was <em>“healthy”</em> purely because it was labelled <em>“Low in salt!”</em> – which is what I imagine a marketer’s wet dream to be like.</p>
<p>Not to forget: </p>
<ul>
<li>High sugar cereals that justify being good for kids because of the vitamins and minerals they inject into the end of the ingredients list.</li>
<li><em>“No Added Cane Sugar!”</em> drinks that swap the cane sugar for fruit sugar (fructose). </li>
<li>The <em>“Heart Foundation Tick of Approval”</em> being slapped onto anything low in fat. </li>
</ul>
<p>With all these options available to mislead the uninformed consumer, it’s no wonder that people find proper nutrition to be so disheartenedly confusing.</p>

<p>So let’s shed some light on some of the most common and pernicious marketing techniques.
The table below outlines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Common food labels</li>
<li>What they’re generally interpreted to mean</li>
<li>What they really mean</li>
<li>What to keep in mind when you read them (red flags)</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve also mentioned the types of food that typically feature these labels. Stacey’s love handles never stood a chance.</p>

<p>Hopefully this will help you out on your next trip to the supermarket – or at the very least give you a good laugh. </p>
<p>The first time I started flipping around boxes and reading the ingredients and nutrition panel of so-called “<em>healthy foods</em>”, I was in the store for well over an hour in awe.</p>
<p>If a lot of what you’ve just read is news to you – you have been warned.</p>

        <title>What is Intermittent Fasting?</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Don’t forget to eat your breakfast Jimmy – it’s the most important meal of the day!”</strong>
<br>
— Well meaning Mother</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well meaning, but wrong. But who could blame her?</p>
<p>Anyone growing up from the 1960s to the 1980s who watched Saturday morning cartoons saw countless advertisements that emphasised the importance of breakfast.</p>
<p>Animated characters and jingles of all sorts taught kids not to head off to school before eating something. Otherwise they wouldn’t have any <em>energy</em>. They wouldn’t be able to <em>focus</em>. What they needed, was a <strong><em>“balanced breakfast”</em></strong>.</p>
<picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--new7">
  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/cheerios-bulk.jpg" alt="Cheerios Commercial">
</picture><p class ="figurecap"> General Mill’s Cheerios: “<em>Energy O’s that help you grow</em>” </p>

<p>According to the TV a <em>“balanced breakfast”</em> may include: Cheerios, Cocoa Puffs, Lucky Charms, Trix, and/or Frosted Flakes. </p>
<p>These cereals battled it out to get into the cupboards of as many families as possible. Little Jimmy’s eating habits depended on which cereal had the coolest cartoon character, or the catchiest jingle.</p>
<p>But no matter which cereal won the battle, <strong>breakfast won the war</strong>. </p>
<p>It was a brutally effective strategy. How often have you heard that <strong><em>“Breakfast is the most important meal of the day”</em></strong>? It’s parroted to us so often that it is almost blasphemous to say otherwise.</p>
<p>Well it turns out that cereal companies may have had other motives when they crowned breakfast as the king of all meals.</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting points out that the noble Emperor Froot Loops III isn’t wearing any clothes.</p>
<picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--new6">

</picture><p class ="figurecap"> Kellog’s Apple Jacks: “<em>A bowl a day gives you energy to play</em>” </p>

<p>When you intermittently fast, you restrict your eating to a pre-defined period of the day. </p>
<p>This generally involves <strong>skipping your morning breakfast</strong>.</p>
<h3>Why Should I Intermittent Fast?</h3><p>Well first off: <strong>why do you eat when you eat right now?</strong> Have you ever actually thought about it? </p>
<p>You probably adopted the eating habits of your parents, who adopted the eating habits of their parents. But don’t blame Nanna – she was just following everyone else.</p>
<p>People tend to reinforce each other’s beliefs in self-perpetuating loops. Each round of mutual confirmation tightens our beliefs further. Until we have little choice but to believe what everyone else believes: <em>“Breakfast is the most important meal of the day”</em>. </p>
<p>So have we always eaten in the mornings? Did we evolve with an around-the-clock buffet, eating 5+ times per day? </p>
<p>No – <strong><em>we evolved with elongated periods of fasting and feeding</em></strong>. </p>
<p>Food was eaten when it was available. If you didn’t kill anything until 2pm, then you fasted until 2pm.</p>
<p>This begs the question – <strong>how did we manage to kill anything without any <em>energy</em> or <em>focus?</em></strong> </p>
<p>From a survival perspective, a lack of food warrants an increased level of concentration. We need to stay focused if we want to catch our next meal.</p>
<p>And this <strong><em>focus</em></strong> is exactly what you experience while fasting.</p>
<picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--new10">
  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/caveman-breakfast.jpg" alt="Caveman breakfast">
</picture><p class ="figurecap"> <em>God Dammit Mum, I said I wanted Cheerios</em> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“But every time I skip breakfast I’m starving – I can’t concentrate!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was the exact same. Worse than that – I would eat a big breakfast and be famished by 11am. <strong>Before I skipped breakfast, I tried everything to make it more satiating.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was told oats were filling, so I ate oats in the mornings. <strong>Hungry at 11am.</strong></li>
<li>I was told fruit was filling, so I added fruit to my oats. <strong>Hungry at 11am.</strong></li>
<li>I was told protein was filling, so I added an egg to my oats (this tastes way better than it sounds). <strong>Hungry at 11am.</strong></li>
<li>I was told almonds were filling... you see the trend?</li>
</ul>
<picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--new5">
  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/oats-breakfast.jpg" alt="Oats for breakfast">
</picture><p class ="figurecap"> Delicious breakfast. Still hungry at 11am. </p>    

<p>I stumbled upon intermittent fasting in search of a better morning. </p>
<p>I was sick of the time lost making and eating breakfast. I was sick of the ups and downs in concentration. And most of all, <strong><em>I was sick of the hunger pangs.</em></strong></p>
<p>So when I heard that I could lose weight, save time, and increase my concentration via skipping breakfast, I was as skeptical as you. But I was willing to give it a shot, <strong>since my current eating habits <em>clearly</em> weren’t working.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“...when I heard that I could lose weight, save time, and increase my concentration via skipping breakfast, I was as skeptical as you.”    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And oh boy was I hungry... for the first week. That’s roughly how long it will take for your hunger hormones to adjust to your new eating routine. After that, pure bliss. Now <strong>I enjoy more <em>time</em>, more <em>focus</em>, but <em>no more hunger.</em></strong></p>
<p>I’ve been intermittent fasting for over 4 years now, and I can’t see myself turning back. It’s amazing what a huge difference such a simple change can make.</p>
<h3>How Do I Intermittent Fast?</h3><p>Intermittent fasting divides your day into two periods. A fasting period, and a feeding period. The feeding period is also called an “<em>eating window”</em>.</p>
<p>No one is eating 24 hrs/day, so we are all fasting and feeding already.</p>
<p>But since we aren’t feeding with a plan in mind, we end up with too large an eating window. Plan “<em>Eat Whenever My Tummy Grumbles</em>” doesn’t count as a plan.</p>
<p>Although we <em>generally</em> stop eating at around 9pm, if your stomach growls at 11pm you might pop back into the kitchen for a snack.</p>
<p>We <em>usually</em> eat breakfast at 8am, but you’re <em>starving</em> this morning. So you have it a little earlier at 7am.</p>
<p>So we fast from our last scoop of ice cream at night to our first spoonful of cereal in the morning. This results in most people fasting for less than 12 hours, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4250148/" target="_blank" title="Meal frequency and timing in health and disease">which is not ideal.</a> </p>

<p>There are various fasting and feeding routines. A common and effective routine is an eating window from 12pm to 8pm each day (<em>made popular as the <a href="http://leangains.com/" target="_blank" title="leangains.com">leangains</a> routine</em>).</p>
<p>Under this routine you don’t start consuming any solid or liquid calories until 12pm, and you stop no later than 8pm.</p>
<p>This has myriad benefits compared to some alternate routines.</p>
<h3>What are the Benefits of Intermittent Fasting?</h3><p>First off, the consistent eating window <strong>regulates your hunger hormones</strong>. The reason your stomach rumbles at 8am is because your body is used to eating at 8am. It’s expecting food.</p>
<p>At your regular breakfast time, your body releases Ghrelin (<em>a hunger hormone</em>) and widens your stomach in preparation for food. <strong><em>This makes you hungry</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Now if you start eating at 12pm, your body adapts to your new eating habits. Your hunger will now develop at 12pm, not 8am. And just like that: <strong>no more morning hunger.</strong></p>
<p>By the same token, you’ll no longer be tempted to snack at night. If you consistently cut off your eating by 8pm, your body will no longer expect food past 8pm.</p>

  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/eating-in-bed.jpg" alt="Man eating midnight snacks in bed">
</picture><p class ="figurecap"> No more midnight snacks </p>

<p>It gets better. <strong><em>When you have less time to eat, you eat less.</em></strong> </p>
<p>You might suspect that you’ll binge after not eating for so long. But most people find that they naturally eat less. This is especially true if you’re eating satiating foods.  <strong>There just isn’t enough time for your fullness to subside</strong>. </p>
<p>Granted you can still go into a calorie surplus if you go overboard.  If you only eat high calorie junk then you will still gain weight. But even then, it’s harder to do. </p>
<p>The fixed eating window is a one-two punch on weight loss. The left punch stops you snacking throughout the day. The right punch doesn’t give you time to regain your hunger. Before you know it, your hunger is knocked out cold. Weight loss becomes a breeze.</p>

<p>So intermittent fasting helps you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get rid of your morning hunger</li>
<li>Improve your concentration</li>
<li>Save time</li>
<li>Eat less</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also emerging evidence that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26094889 " target="_blank" title="A Periodic Diet that Mimics Fasting Promotes Multi-System Regeneration, Enhanced Cognitive Performance, and Healthspan">fasting can help you live longer</a>. Intermittent fasting and longevity will be explored more in another post. </p>
<p>If you’re currently fit, healthy, have plenty of spare time, and have no trouble staying focused, then keep on doing what you’re doing. But if you want to improve in any of these areas, then consider intermittent fasting. </p>

<p>This page breaks down how to use the <a href="/calorie-calculator/" target="_blank" title="Calorie and Macro Calculator">calorie calculator web application</a> to work out your daily calories and macronutrients.</p>
<p>The calculator allows you to forecast your estimated weight change per week based on your calorie deficit/surplus. You can also adjust your protein, fat, and carbohydrate macros as desired. </p>
<p>Your <a href="#bmr" title="What does BMR mean?">BMR</a> and <a href="#tdee" title="What does TDEE mean?">TDEE</a> are displayed for convenience.</p>
<h3 id="stats">Stats</h3>
<p id="start-p">Here you input the following basic personal information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age (in years)</li>
<li>Weight (in kilograms or pounds)</li>
<li>Height (in centimetres or inches)</li>
<li>Gender (male or female)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="modifiers">Modifiers</h3>
<h4 id="activity-level">Activity Level</h4>
<p>Your <strong>Activity Level</strong> serves as a multiplier on top of your <a title="BMR Defined" target="_blank" href="/blog/calorie-calculator-how-to#bmr"><strong>BMR</strong></a> (Basal Metabolic Rate). The result of this calculation is called your <a title="TDEE Defined" target="_blank" href="/blog/calorie-calculator-how-to#tdee"><strong>TDEE</strong></a> (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).</p>
<p>Think of your BMR as the energy you would need to keep alive if you were in a coma. Energy required for processes like breathing, blood circulation, controlling body temperature, cell growth, etc.</p>
<p>What you care about though, is your TDEE. This is the <strong><em>total amount of energy you need each day to maintain your body weight</em></strong> after you factor in all of your activity.</p>
<p>This is not the same as your BMR, as even the least active among us aren’t lying motionless in bed all day.</p>
<p>These are the Activity Level modifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sedentary:</strong> Little or no exercise, office job (1.2x)</li>
<li><strong>Lightly Active:</strong> Light daily activity &amp; exercise 1-3 days per week (1.375x)</li>
<li><strong>Moderately Active:</strong> Moderate daily activity &amp; exercise 3-5 days per week (1.55x)</li>
<li><strong>Very Active:</strong> Physically demanding lifestyle &amp; exercise 6-7 days per week (1.725x)</li>
<li><strong>Extremely Active:</strong> Hard daily exercise/sports &amp; physical job (1.9x)</li>
</ul>
<p>Be warned: <strong>most people tend to overestimate their activity level</strong>. </p>
<p>This is usually due to them basing their activity level on their number of gym sessions per week. This is not the right way to go about it.</p>
<p>Your activity level is primarily based off of what you do <strong><em>outside</em></strong> the gym. Four 1 hour strength training sessions at the gym each week is less than 2 hours of actual activity. It does <strong><em>not</em></strong> result in a large number of calories burnt.</p>
<p>Conversely, a teacher on her feet for the lions share of the week is most likely <em>“Lightly Active”</em>. The intermittent cardio throughout the day adds up.</p>
<p>If your only activity outside the office is the gym, put yourself down as <em>“Sedentary”</em>. You <em>might</em> be slightly over depending on your intensity and frequency – but more likely you won’t be. You can adjust your estimate based on the first couple week’s progress. </p>
<p>If you think you’re on the line between levels and it could go either way – go with the lower estimate. </p>
<h4 id="goal">Goal</h4>
<p>This dropdown provides an easy way to match your qualitative weight loss/gain goal with a quantitative value. The options are:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Lose Weight (–20%)</li>
<li>Slowly Lose Weight (–10%)</li>
<li>Maintain Weight (0%)</li>
<li>Slowly Gain Weight (+10%)</li>
<li>Gain Weight (+20%)</li>
</ul>
<p>The number in the proceeding brackets specifies the caloric deficit/surplus. For example, (+10%) means that your daily calorie goal will be 10% higher than your <a href="#tdee" title="What does TDEE mean?">TDEE</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can input a specific calorie goal in the <strong>Calorie Deficit/Surplus</strong> section.</p>
<h4 id="how-much-protein">How Much Protein?</h4>
<p>Here there are 3 standardised options:</p>
<ul id="ul-nm7">
<li>1g per pound</li>
<li>0.82g per pound</li>
<li>1.5g per pound</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1g per pound</strong> is the standard and recommended option. This provides you with enough protein to facilitate muscle growth <strong><em>with a large margin of error</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>0.82g per pound</strong> still provides enough protein to facilitate muscle growth. Think of this as a lower bar for the amount of protein you should be consuming. Although the subject of hot debate, current science points to 0.82g protein/pound being <strong><em>enough</em></strong> protein. </p>
<p>Although it’s <em>unlikely</em> additional protein will result in increased gains, you still may want to consider a higher protein intake as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protein is a more satiating macronutrient <a title="The effects of high protein diets on thermogenesis, satiety and weight loss: a critical review" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0021577/">[1]</a></li>
<li>A higher protein intake restricts your food choices, forcing you to eat less junk</li>
<li>The TEF (Thermic Effect of Food) means protein is closer to 3.2 kcal per gram, not 4 kcal per gram <a title="A perspective on food energy standards for nutrition labelling." target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11299073">[2]</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The above reasoning is why you might even want to consider <strong>1.5g per pound</strong>. </p>
<p>If you’re an expert in going way too far with your cheat meals to the point of ruining your diet – 1.5g per pound is for you.</p>
<h4 id="fat-carb-calorie-split">Fat/Carb Calorie Split</h4>
<p>This is the percentage split (<em>calorie-wise</em>) between fat and carbs <em>after</em> you account for your protein intake.</p>
<p>You have a good amount of leeway in your distribution between carbs and fat. <em><strong>The split between carbs and fat is largely a matter of personal preference</strong></em>. So long as you’re not on the extreme of either side, there is no point stressing about the allocation. 

<p>Some of us feel better with more carbs and less fat, and some of us feel better with more fat and less carbs. In general the more active you are, the more likely you’ll suit a higher carb intake.</p></p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, <strong>you’ll want to consume no less than 0.25g fat per pound, or approximately 0.5g fat per kilogram</strong>. </p>
<p>Although this may seem like a low bar, it can be broken when you’re on a hard cut and hence don’t have that many calories to work with. Getting less than this amount of fat for an elongated period of time can easily lead to dry skin and/or hair. Would not recommend.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<h4 id="bmr">BMR</h4>
<p>Stands for your <strong>Basal Metabolic Rate</strong>. </p>
<p>Essentially the amount of energy you would need to keep alive if you were in a coma. Energy required for processes like breathing, blood circulation, controlling body temperature, cell growth, etc.</p>
<p>This is calculated via your Age, Weight, Height, and Gender. It is then multiplied by your <strong>Activity Level</strong> to give your TDEE.</p>
<h4 id="tdee">TDEE</h4>
<p>Stands for your <strong>Total Daily Energy Expenditure</strong>. Also known as your “<em>maintenance calories</em>”. </p>
<p>This is the <strong><em>total amount of energy you need each day to maintain your body weight</em></strong> after you factor in all of your activity.</p>
<p>So in an ideal world where you eat your exact TDEE each day, you would maintain the same body weight.</p>
<p>In reality this never happens due to the variance in our daily activity, the exact amount of food we eat, and water weight fluctuations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, getting a ballpark figure of your TDEE is all you really need to get going. You can track your progress against your estimate and readjust as required.</p>
<h4 id="daily-calories-and-macros">Daily Calories and Macros</h4>
<p>This is final result of all of your input data. It breaks down the Calories, Protein, Fat, and Carbohydrates you should eat each day to reach your physique goals.</p>
<p><strong>Do not stress about small deviations from these numbers</strong>. A &#177;5% difference will not affect your physique. </p>
<p>Why? Each of these numbers have error built in. Even the lower protein intake of 0.82g per pound was based on a 95% confidence interval. </p>
<p><strong>All calorie counters are approximations.</strong> Regardless of how many decimal places worth of carbs MyFitnessPal tells you are in your 160.8 g apple – it’s only an estimate. </p>
<p>Use the calculated values as a solid approximation. Adjust your estimate as required based off of your weight loss/gain during the first few weeks of your diet. If you need help with this, ask. I plan on making a tool to help with this in the near future. </p>
<h4 id="estimated-weight-loss-per-week">Estimated Weight Loss per Week</h4>
<p>This estimate is based on the ~3500 calories in one pound of fat.</p>
<p>E.g. A 500 calorie deficit per day is around 1 pound of fat loss per week.</p>
<p>So what kind of weight gain/loss should you aim for? The below serves as a <strong><em>practical and realistic</em></strong> expectation for a 6 to 12 month program. </p>
<p><strong>Fat Loss with Minimal Muscle Loss</strong></p>
<ul id="ul-nm1">
<li>2 pounds per week in the obese (BMI of 30 or above) </li>
<li>1 pound per week in the overweight (BMI of 25 to 30)</li>
<li>&frac12; pound per week, or less, in guys who are lean and trying to get even leaner </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Muscle Gain with Minimal Fat Gain</strong></p>
<ul id="ul-nm2">
<li>2 to 3 pounds per month in novices and advanced beginners (those with less than 2 years of consistent strength training)</li>
<li>1 to 2 pounds per month in intermediates (those with 2 to 4 years of consistent training) </li>
<li>&frac12; pound per month in advanced lifters who are close to their genetic ceiling</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to note that <strong><em>the first few weeks and months will bring the biggest losses/gains</em></strong>. </p>
<p>For example, it’s common to drop a full 2kg in your first week of cutting – especially if you lowered your carb intake. This is great for motivation, but it’s not a realistic representation of what you should expect long term. </p>
<p>This exaggerated change is primarily due to changes in water weight, as well as the initial shock your body experiences from the abrupt change in calorie intake. </p>
<p><strong>What this means</strong> is that you shouldn’t fret over your weight loss/gains plateauing after the first few weeks. Rather, you should expect it. Don’t let it mess with your motivation.</p>
<h3 id="the-leangains-method">The Leangains Method Calculator</h3>
<p>The following information is specific to the Leangains calculator (<em>in the “Diet” dropdown</em>). This is the calorie and macronutrient calculator recommended by <a title="About: Martin Berkhan" target="_blank" href="https://leangains.com/about-me/">Martin Berkhan</a> in his book <a title="Amazon: The Leangains Method" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Leangains-Method-Researched-Practiced-Perfected-ebook/dp/B07G3GFLTX">The Leangains Method</a>. </p>
<p>To calculate your <a href="#tdee" title="What does TDEE mean?">TDEE</a>, multiply your body weight in kilograms by a base value. This base value starts at 28 for men, and 26 for women. </p>
<p>This base value is altered depending on your <em>Stats</em> – age, height,  body fat, muscle mass, and steps taken each day.</p>
<h4 id="age">Age</h4>
<p>Your age alters your base value in the following way:</p>
<ul id="ul-nm8">
<li>&lt;25 years old: +0.5</li>
<li>25-45 years old: 0</li>
<li>&gt;45 years old: –0.5</li>
</ul>
<p>So an 18 year old man/woman would add 0.5 to their base value.</p>
<h4 id="height">Height</h4>
<p>How your height alters your base value depends on your gender:</p>
<p><strong>For Men</strong> </p>
<ul id="ul-nm9">
<li>&lt;167 cm: –1</li>
<li>167-185 cm: 0</li>
<li>&gt;185 cm: +1</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>167 cm &ap; 5 feet, 5 inches = 65 inches</p>
<p>185 cm &ap; 6 feet, 1 inches = 73 inches</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>For Women</strong> </p>
<ul id="ul-nm10">
<li>&lt;153 cm: –1</li>
<li>153-170 cm: 0</li>
<li>&gt;170 cm: +1</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>153 cm &ap; 5 feet, 0 inches = 60 inches</p>
<p>170 cm &ap; 5 feet, 7 inches = 67 inches</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a 175 cm tall guy would keep his base value the same, while a 175 cm tall woman would add 1 to her base value.</p>
<h4 id="body-fat">Body Fat</h4>
<p>How your body fat percentage alters your base value depends on your gender:</p>
<p><strong>For Men</strong> </p>
<ul id="ul-nm3">
<li>&lt;10% body fat: +0.5 </li>
<li>11-19% body fat: 0</li>
<li>20-24% body fat: –0.5 </li>
<li>25-29% body fat: –1.5</li>
<li>30-34% body fat: –2.5</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Women</strong> </p>
<ul id="ul-nm4">
<li>&lt;18% body fat: +0.5 </li>
<li>19-27% body fat: 0</li>
<li>28-32% body fat: –0.5 </li>
<li>33-37% body fat: –1.5</li>
<li>38-42% body fat: –2.5</li>
</ul>
<p>So a man with 22% body fat would subtract 1.5 from his base value. Whereas a woman with 25% body fat would keep her base value the same.</p>
<h4 id="muscle-mass">Muscle Mass</h4>
<p>Your muscle mass alters your base value in the following way:</p>
<ul id="ul-nm5">
<li>Standard: 0</li>
<li>Muscular: +0.5</li>
<li>Very Muscular: +1</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <em>Very Muscular</em> is only applicable to males. Martin recommends that those with a Fat-Free Mass Index (FFMI) &gt;22 choose <em>Muscular</em>. For <em>Very Muscular</em>, your FFMI should be &gt;24. </p>
<p>There is no FFMI recommendation for women – women can use <em>Muscular</em> at their own discretion.</p>
<h4 id="goal-lg">Goal (LG-specific)</h4>
<p>Your goal calories deviate from your <a href="#tdee" title="What does TDEE mean?">TDEE</a> depending on your gender, and whether you’re cutting or bulking. Either way it is a constant number (<em>as opposed to a percentage</em>).</p>
<p>For men, a &#177;500 calorie deficit/surplus depending on whether you’re cutting or bulking. </p>
<p>For women, a &#177;350 calorie deficit/surplus depending on whether you’re cutting or bulking. </p>
<p>This will result in an approximate weight loss/gain of 0.5 kilograms (1.1 pounds) for men, or 0.35 kilograms (0.77 pounds) for women.</p>
<h4 id="steps">Steps</h4>
<p>This is an approximation for the number of steps you take each day. If you want an accurate result, use a pedometer or phone application such as Health (iOS) or Google Fit (Android). </p>
<p>If you’re sedentary for most of your week or are unsure, assume a value of 5000 steps (<em>note that steps less than 6000 have the same activity multiplier</em>). </p>
<p>Your base value is altered as follows: </p>
<ul id="ul-nm6">
<li>&lt;6000 steps: 0 </li>
<li>6000-7500 steps: +0.5 </li>
<li>Add another +0.5 for every 1250 step increment above 7500 steps </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, someone taking 9000 steps each day would add 1.5 to their base value.</p>
<h4 id="how-much-protein-lg">How much Protein? (LG-specific)</h4>
<p>The Leangains Method recommends getting as close to 60% of your calorie intake from protein as you can. This <strong><em>extremely</em></strong> high protein recommendation is to reap benefits <em>outside</em> of pure muscle building. Namely protein’s high TEF (Thermic Effect of Food), as well as the added difficulty of making poor food choices when you’re eating a high protein diet. </p>
<p>Martin himself finds 55% protein to be his sweet spot. He notes that if you find 60% protein too restrictive then you can drop it down to 50% – which he believes is doable. </p>
<p>If you still think this protein intake is too high, then consider switching the “<em>Diet</em>” dropdown of the <a href="/calorie-calculator/" target="_blank" title="Calorie and Macro Calculator">calorie calculator</a> to “<em>Standard</em>” and selecting a lower protein intake of 0.82g/pound or 1g/pound. This gives you more leeway with your other macros while still provides enough protein for muscle building.
