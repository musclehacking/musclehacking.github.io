id="post-thumbnail" class="intrinsic intrinsic--head"> <img src="/img/naturally-flavoured.jpg" title="A Healthy, Organic, Naturally Flavoured Post" alt="What does naturally flavoured mean" class="intrinsic-item img-fluid"></picture><p class="figurecap">If you’ve ever been to the supermarket, you've probably seen many of these terms before.</p></header><div class="post-body"><p>Healthy. Organic. Gluten free. Fat free. No Added Sugar. Do these labels sound familiar? </p>
<p>They’re a great way for a company to sincerely inform you of the positive aspects of their product. But more often than not, they’re used to dupe you into believing that what you’re buying is somehow ‘<em>good for you</em>’. This can lead to problems if you’re not aware of exactly what a claim means.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a typical example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stacey has just started a new diet, and is browsing her local supermarket</li>
<li>Stacey buys a pack of nut bars that claim to be a <em>“healthy snack”</em></li>
<li>Every time Stacey gets hungry between meals, she nibbles on a nut bar</li>
<li>2 weeks and a couple boxes later, Stacey is 2 pounds heavier</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be a very frustrating experience for Stacey, who was under the impression that replacing her favourite chocolate with this <em>“healthy snack”</em> would help her lose weight. </p>
<p>Stacey’s weight loss woes can be attributed to clever marketing blended with a lack consumer understanding. Like many people, Stacey has associated the word <em>“healthy”</em> to <em>“low calorie”</em>.  <strong><em>But “healthy” and “low calorie” do not mean the same thing.</em></strong>  </p>
<p>Something is usually deemed <em>healthy</em> (or <em>“good for you”</em>) due to it having a lot of <a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/vitamins-and-minerals" target="_blank" title="Micronutrient defined">micronutrients</a> (i.e. vitamins &amp; minerals), regardless of its <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/macronutrients-as-sources-of-food-energy/DDF89DE14E92D39D56A45FBAA3F00A55" target="_blank" title="Macronutrient defined">macronutrient</a> content. Macronutrients are fat, protein and carbohydrates. They define the calorie content of your food,  and hence the success of your weight loss efforts. </p>
<p>If Stacey were brave enough to flip the box and read the nutrition label, she would find that these <em>healthy</em> nut bars have a lot of fat in them. Although many would argue these to be <em>“healthy fats”</em>, this does not relieve them of their high calorie content. If you’re not careful with your portion size they can easily lead to unwanted weight gain.</p>
<p>Note that the supplier hasn’t actually lied about their product. Nuts are <em>healthy</em>, but something can be <em>healthy</em> without requiring it to be low in calories – nuts being a prime example. The conflation of these characteristics can lead people to believe that a product is something it’s not.</p>
<picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--new">
  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/walnuts-vs-chocolate.jpg" alt="Calories in Chocolate vs. Walnuts">
</picture><p class="figurecap"> Walnuts actually contain more calories per gram than chocolate, with around ~65 calories/10g, while chocolate is ~50-60 calories/10g [depending on the type and % of cacao] <a title="Calories in Walnuts" target="_blank" href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/12155?fgcd=&manu=&format=&count=&max=25&offset=&sort=default&order=asc&qlookup=walnut&ds=SR&qt=&qp=&qa=&qn=&q=&ing=">[1]</a>
<a title="Calories in Chocolate" target="_blank" href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/19081?man=&lfacet=&count=&max=25&qlookup=chocolate&offset=&sort=default&format=Abridged&reportfmt=other&rptfrm=&ndbno=&nutrient1=&nutrient2=&nutrient3=&subset=&totCount=&measureby=&Qv=1&Q333352=1&Q333353=1&Qv=10&Q333352=1&Q333353=1">[2]</a></p> 

<p>Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not hating on nut bars. I’m merely using them as an example to illustrate my point. I could just as easily have talked about candy that boasts about having <em>“No Artificial Colours or Flavours”</em> or being <em>“99% Fat Free”</em>. The number of people who read these labels and think <em>“These are good for me”</em> is concerning. Once familiar with this type of advertising, you’ll instead instantly conclude: <em>“Made with 100% Sugar”</em>.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that sugar is the devil and you should avoid it at all costs – because it definitely isn’t and you definitely shouldn’t. But when you indulge on a sweet treat it’s important to be aware that it is just that – a sweet treat. Otherwise there’ll be no guilt stopping you from heading down to your local burger joint and ordering a big mac and fries for round 2. I mean, why not – you’ve eaten so well today! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But when you indulge on a sweet treat make sure you’re mentally aware that it is just that – a sweet treat.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such an eating habit can easily lead to a calorie surplus and unwanted weight gain.</p>

</picture><p class="figurecap"> Don’t worry – it’s Gluten Free </p>

<p>I don’t think this is purely a marketing problem. If a candy company wants to accurately label its product as having <em>“No Artificial Colours or Flavours”</em>, they should be able to. That way those looking to buy candy without artificial colours or flavours will be able to easily identify what products they can choose from.</p>
<p>To fix this issue long term, we need to bridge the gap in consumer knowledge. <em>“No Artificial Colours or Flavours”</em> on a pack of candy should not distract you from the fact that candy is 100% sugar. Although it would be convenient, I think it’s unrealistic to expect a company to actively market such information. Until crooked teeth become fashionable, we probably won’t see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No artificial colours or flavours. Boatloads of sugar.”</p>
<p>— Nestl&eacute;  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The underlying issue is the <strong><em>information asymmetry</em></strong> between suppliers and consumers. Suppliers know exactly what’s in their products. Consumers don’t. The best they can do is read and interpret the product’s labelling. But <strong><em>the goal of most labelling is to sell, not to inform</em></strong>. So a consumer must be able to correctly interpret what a label (or buzzword) means.</p>
<p>Although the average consumer is better at reading a label than they used to be, that doesn’t say much. I’ve known people who thought a product was <em>“healthy”</em> purely because it was labelled <em>“Low in salt!”</em> – which is what I imagine a marketer’s wet dream to be like.</p>
<p>Not to forget: </p>
<ul>
<li>High sugar cereals that justify being good for kids because of the vitamins and minerals they inject into the end of the ingredients list.</li>
<li><em>“No Added Cane Sugar!”</em> drinks that swap the cane sugar for fruit sugar (fructose). </li>
<li>The <em>“Heart Foundation Tick of Approval”</em> being slapped onto anything low in fat. </li>
</ul>
<p>With all these options available to mislead the uninformed consumer, it’s no wonder that people find proper nutrition to be so disheartenedly confusing.</p>

<p>So let’s shed some light on some of the most common and pernicious marketing techniques.
The table below outlines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Common food labels</li>
<li>What they’re generally interpreted to mean</li>
<li>What they really mean</li>
<li>What to keep in mind when you read them (red flags)</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve also mentioned the types of food that typically feature these labels. Stacey’s love handles never stood a chance.</p>

<p>Hopefully this will help you out on your next trip to the supermarket – or at the very least give you a good laugh. </p>
<p>The first time I started flipping around boxes and reading the ingredients and nutrition panel of so-called “<em>healthy foods</em>”, I was in the store for well over an hour in awe.</p>
