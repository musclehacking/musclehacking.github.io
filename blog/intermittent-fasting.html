</blockquote>
<p>Whoa, bit harsh there Jimmy. While it&#39;s true that you don’t need to eat breakfast in the mornings, Mom had good intentions.</p>
<p>After all, it&#39;s all she&#39;s ever known.</p>
<p>Anyone growing up in the United States from the 1960s to the 1980s who watched Saturday morning cartoons saw countless advertisements that emphasised the importance of breakfast.</p>
<p>Animated characters and jingles of all sorts taught kids not to head off to school before eating something. Otherwise they wouldn&#39;t have any <em>energy</em>. They wouldn&#39;t be able to <em>focus</em>. What they needed, was a <strong><em>&quot;balanced breakfast&quot;</em></strong>.</p>

</picture></p><p class="figurecap"> General Mill&#39;s Cheerios: &quot;<em>Energy O&#39;s that help you grow</em>&quot; </p>
<p>According to the TV a <em>&quot;balanced breakfast&quot;</em> may include: Cheerios, Cocoa Puffs, Lucky Charms, Trix, and/or Frosted Flakes. These cereals fought to get into the cupboards of as many American families as possible. A child&#39;s eating habits depended on which cereal had the coolest cartoon character, or the catchiest jingle.</p>
<p>No matter which cereal won the battle, <strong>breakfast won the war</strong>. It was a brutally effective strategy. How often have you heard that <strong><em>&quot;Breakfast is the most important meal of the day&quot;</em></strong>? It&#39;s parroted to us so often that it&#39;s almost blasphemous to say otherwise.</p>
<p>Well, I was never one for Sunday school. Nor am I a fan of breakfast. As it turns out, <strong><em>cereal companies may have had ulterior motives</em></strong> when they asserted breakfast to be the king of all meals. Who would have thought?</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting points out that the emperor isn’t wearing any clothes.</p>

<p>When you intermittently fast, you confine your eating to a pre-defined period of the day. This generally involves <strong>skipping your morning breakfast</strong>.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3><p>Well, why do you eat when you eat right now? Have you ever actually thought about it? You probably adopted the eating habits of your parents, who adopted the eating habits of their parents. But don’t blame Nanna – she was just following everyone else.</p>
<p>People tend to reinforce each other&#39;s beliefs in self-perpetuating loops. Each round of mutual confirmation tightens our beliefs further. Until we have little choice but to believe what everyone else believes: <em>&quot;Breakfast is the most important meal of the day&quot;</em>. </p>
<p>So have we always eaten in the mornings? Did we evolve with an around-the-clock buffet, eating 5+ times per day? </p>
<p>No. We evolved with elongated periods of fasting and feeding. Food was eaten when it was available. If you didn&#39;t kill anything until 2pm, then you fasted until 2pm.</p>
<p>But hold on – <strong>how did we manage to kill anything without any <em>energy</em> or <em>focus?</em></strong> </p>
<p>From a survival perspective, a lack of food would warrant an increased level of concentration. We had better stay focused if we want to catch our next meal.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what you experience while fasting.</p>

<p>I know, I know:</p>
<p><em><strong>&quot;But every time I skip breakfast I’m starving – I can&#39;t concentrate!”</strong></em></p>
<p>I was the exact same. Worse than that – I would eat a big breakfast and be famished by 11am. <strong>Before I skipped breakfast, I tried everything to make it more satiating.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was told oats were filling, so I ate oats in the mornings. <strong>Hungry at 11am.</strong></li>
<li>I was told fruit was filling, so I added fruit to my oats. <strong>Hungry at 11am.</strong></li>
<li>I was told protein was filling, so I added an egg to my oats (this tastes way better than it sounds). <strong>Hungry at 11am.</strong></li>
<li>I was told almonds were filling... you see the trend?</li>

</picture></p><p class="figurecap"> Delicious breakfast. Still hungry at 11am. </p>    
<p>I stumbled upon intermittent fasting in search of a better morning. I was sick of the time lost making and eating breakfast. I was sick of the ups and downs in concentration. And most of all, <strong><em>I was sick of the hunger pangs.</em></strong></p>
<p>So when I heard that I could lose weight, save time, and increase my concentration via skipping breakfast, I was as skeptical as you. But. I was willing to give it a shot, <strong>since my current eating habits <em>clearly</em> weren’t working.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“...when I heard that I could lose weight, save time, and increase my concentration via skipping breakfast, I was as skeptical as you.”    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And oh boy was I hungry... for the first week. That’s roughly how long it will take for your hunger hormones to adjust to your new eating routine. After that, pure bliss. Now <strong>I enjoy more <em>time</em>, more <em>focus</em>, but <em>no more hunger.</em></strong></p>
<p>I’ve been intermittent fasting for over 4 years now, and I can’t see myself turning back. It’s amazing what a huge difference such a simple change can make.</p>
<h3>How?</h3><p>Intermittent fasting defines your day into two periods. A fasting period, and a feeding period. The latter is also referred to as an “<em>eating window”</em>.</p>
<p>No one is eating around the clock, so everyone is already fasting and feeding naturally. But. We aren’t doing it intentionally, which results in too large an eating window.</p>
<p>Although we <em>generally</em> stop eating at around 9pm, if your stomach growls at 11pm you might pop back into the kitchen for a snack.</p>
<p>You <em>usually</em> eat breakfast at 8am, but you’re starving this morning. So you have it a little earlier at 7am.</p>
<p>So we fast from our last scoop of ice cream at night to our first spoonful of cereal in the morning. This results in most people fasting for less than 12 hours. Not ideal.</p>
<p><picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--new9">
  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/homer2-min.jpg" alt="">
</picture></p><p class="figurecap"> Just a nibble? </p>
<p>There are many different fasting and feeding routines. One popular and effective routine is an eating window from 12pm to 8pm each day (<em>made popular as the <a href="http://leangains.com/" target="_blank" title="leangains.com">leangains</a> routine</em>).</p>
<p>This means that you don’t start consuming solid or liquid calories until 12pm, and you stop no later than 8pm.</p>
<p>This has myriad benefits compared to some alternate routines.</p>
<p>Firstly, the consistent eating window <strong>regulates your hunger hormones</strong>. The reason your stomach rumbles at 8am is because your body is used to eating at 8am. It’s expecting food.</p>
<p>At your regular breakfast time, your body releases Ghrelin (<em>a primary hunger hormone</em>) and widens your stomach in preparation for food. <strong><em>This makes you hungry</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Now if you start eating at 12pm, your body adapts to your new eating habits. Your hunger will now develop at 12pm, not 8am. And just like that: <strong>no more morning hunger.</strong></p>
<p>By the same token, you’ll no longer be tempted to snack at night. If you consistently cut off your eating by 8pm, your body will no longer expect food past 8pm.</p>
<p><picture class="intrinsic intrinsic--2">
  <img class="intrinsic-item" src="/img/homer7-min.jpg" alt="">
</picture></p><p class="figurecap"> No more midnight snacks </p>
<p>It gets better. <strong><em>When you have less time to eat, you eat less.</em></strong> </p>
<p>You might suspect that you’ll binge after not eating for so long. But most people find that they naturally eat less. This is especially true if you’re eating satiating foods.  <strong>There just isn&#39;t enough time for your fullness to subside</strong>. </p>
<p>Granted you can still go into a calorie surplus if you go overboard.  If you only eat high calorie junk then you will still gain weight. But even then, it’s harder to do. </p>
<p>The fixed eating window is a one-two punch on weight loss. The left punch stops you snacking throughout the day. The right punch doesn’t give you time to regain your hunger. Before you know it, your hunger is knocked out cold. Weight loss becomes a breeze.</p>

<p>So intermittent fasting helps you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get rid of your morning hunger</li>
<li>Improve your concentration</li>
<li>Save time</li>
<li>Eat less</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also emerging evidence that fasting can help you live longer (<em>link</em>). That will be explored more in another post. </p>
<p>If you’re currently fit, healthy, have plenty of spare time, and have no trouble staying focused, then keep on doing what you’re doing. But if you want to improve in any of these areas, then consider intermittent fasting. </p>
